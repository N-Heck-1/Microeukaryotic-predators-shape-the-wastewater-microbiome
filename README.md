# Microeukaryotic Predators Shape the Wastewater Microbiome.

This repository contains data and scripts of the paper [Heck _et al._, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135423007297). Making use of the scripts in the manner outlined in this description and the data files in [Original Data](https://github.com/N-Heck-1/Microeukaryotic-predators-shape-the-wastewater-microbiome/tree/main/original_data), the results and figures of said paper, as wel as the intermediary steps, can be recreated.

## Data access, quality filtering, assembly, and Taxonomic assignment

### Data access

The publicly available dataset used consisted of shotgun metatranscriptomic sequences provided by [Herold et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19006-2).

- [Data Access](01_Data_Access.md) - These first steps concern how it was accessed and downloaded from the SRA.

### Quality filtering

Assessing read quality [using fastqc](bash/quality_controller.sh).


### Assembly and Taxonomic assignment

## Removal of outliers

## Statistical analyses

### NMDS

### PCoA and PERMANOVA

### variance partitioning

## Network analysis
